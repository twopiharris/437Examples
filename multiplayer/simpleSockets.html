    <h1>Simple Sockets</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Simple Sockets is a simplified multiplayer game system using
    websockets and node.js. It can be used for any HTML5 application
    on modern browsers that support the websockets standard, and 
    any server that can run node.js.
    </p>

    <p>
    The library is general enough to be used in any application, but
    it is specifically geared for use with the simpleGame.js game
    engine.  The library features methods that make it very easy to 
    share sprite data between simpleGame implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
    The simpleSockets library was written by Andy Harris, and is
    released under GPL in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
    The library has two main components:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>gameserver.js</strong> is a websockets server. The server
          needs to be running before any clients are connected, and 
          manages all cross-client communication.  You generally will
          not need to make any changes to the server</li>
      <li><strong>gameClient.js</strong> is a javascript library file
          meant to be included in your clients with the script tag. It
          contains the GameClient object which vastly simplifies 
          communication to the server (and thus the other clients.) It
          also contains a couple of utility functions and variables.</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2>Introducing gameserver.js</h2>

    <p>
    This system begins with gameserver.js.  This is a 
    simple mechanism to pass information among multiple players
    (as many as you want.)  The gameserver.js is a bare-bones 
    webSocket server.  
    </p>

    <p>
    gameserver.js requires node.js and nodejs-websocket.  Use npm to 
    install nodejs-websocket if it is not currently in your build.
    Be sure to change the URL to the server where your game server is
    located.  Of course you'll need to run gameserver.js through node
    before communication will work.
    </p>

    <h2>Using gameClient.js</h2>
    <p>
    In addition to the server, there is a simple object called
    GameClient included in the gameClient.js.  Instantiate this object
    (for sake of documentation I'll call the instance gc) when the page
    loads.  The constructor will require the URL of the running 
    js file (for example: 
    <code>ws.http://localhost:8001/gameserver.js</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
    The GameClient class has the following methods:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GameClient(url)</strong>
          constructor. Takes the url of a running gameserver.</li>
      <li><strong>connect()</strong>
          connects this client to the server</li>
      <li><strong>sendMessage(key, value)</strong>
          sends state data of this client to the server.
          key is an identifier for this client, and value
          is any string value (can be CSV or JSON string)</li>
      <li><strong>close()</strong>
          closes the connection to the server.  Connection can be 
          re-opened with another connect() call</li>
      <li><strong>getState(message, searchKey)</strong>
          Utility function for finding the state string associated
	  with a client key. Returns state string associated with
	  the key or an error message.</li>
      <li><strong>getKeys(message)</strong>
          Utility that returns all client keys associated with 
	  the message. Returns an array of strings.</li>
      <li><strong>sendSprite(key, sprite)</strong>
          Sends a message to the server containing the image, 
          x, y, width, height, and imageAngle of the sprite. 
          This feature expects you to be using a simpleGame 
          sprite object.</strong>
      <li><strong>updateRemoteSprite(key, sprite)</strong>
          given a key and a local sprite, updates the sprite
          based on values sent to the server through the 
          sendSprite() method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Required Functions in the Client HTML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>init()</strong>
          Does not need to be called init, but some sort of initialization
	  needs to instantiate the GameClient class and connect to the
	  server.</li>
      <li><strong>getMessage(text)</strong>
          Automatically called whenever any clients are updated
	  text is the message string (also stored in stateData.)
	  Use this function to respond to an update if you need 
          anything more than lookups. The function is defined
          (but empty) in gameClient.js, but it can be overwritten 
          in your local file
          to have some kind of action happen on every event.
          This can be especially useful for reading custom messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About stateData</h2>
    <p>
    Every time a connected client updates, the getMessage() function
    of each client is triggered, passing a message string as a 
    parameter.  This message string consists of a multiline string,
    one line per client.  The string begins with the client key 
    followed by a pipe character and the rest of the character string
    </p>

    <p>
    Including the gameClient.js file also provides access to the global
    <code>stateData</code> string, which is automatically updated on 
    every data
    refresh. You can access this string directly if you wish (though
    you should not change it directly.)  It is easier to use the 
    convenience functions <code>getKeys()</code> to get an array of
    client keys in the system, and the <code>getNode(key)</code> 
    function to retrieve the data (normally position and state data)
    associated with a particular key.
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course if you're using simpleGame, it's even easier to use the 
    specialized sprite methods to send the status of a local sprite to the
    server and retrieve the status of remote sprites.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you need more specialized control, you can always send a message
    and have your client read the message to determine what it should 
    do.
    </p>

    <h2>Files in this package</h2>
    <p>
    The following files are included in this release:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href = "gameserver.js">gameserver.js</a>
          The basic game server. Must be run via node.
          <code>node gameserver.js</code> Node.js can be found at
          <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>.
          You will also need the nodejs-websocket library. If node is
          installed, go to your working directory and use this
          command to install the library: 
          <code>npm install jodejs-websocket</code>. If you're running
          Mac or Linux you may need sudo or admin access.</li>
      <li><a href = "gameClient.js">gameClient.js</a>
          Place this file in the same directory as your game files, and
          include it in your client files much like including the 
          simpleGame engine.  (It may be added to simpleGame in a later
          version.)</li>
      <li><a href = "gameClient.html">gameClient.html</a>
          Use this page to test the system.  The game client page
          includes the ability to add your own test data as well as 
          buttons to manually connect, disconnect, and update. Run
          two copies of this program in separate windows to see how
          data is being passed.</li>
      <li><a href = "player.html">player.html</a>
          A simple demo of the library used with simpleGame.  Run this
          page in your browser and control the player with the arrow keys.
          </li>
      <li><a href "remote.html">remote.html</a>
          The companion to player.html. If player.html is in one window and
          reflect.html is in another (and of course the server is running)
          all the player's behavior is immediately reflected onto the 
          reflect page.  Use these pages to see the general flow of
          remote sprite updating.</li>
      <li><a href = "simpleSockets.html">simpleSockets.html</a>
          This documentation file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>
    Note there is absolutely no security in this system.  All data is
    passed as trusted data, so it's up to you to make sure it does what
    it's supposed to do. There is also no checking for dropped clients,
    so a dropped client will simply freeze.  You may want to put some 
    client-side code to check for this.
    </p>

    <p>
    You may have to experiment with your firewall or OS settings to run
    the clients on a remote machine.  All code is tested on localhost, 
    but it may require some more experimentation to get things working
    on a local network or beyond.
